This is a project centered around an application in which you can create a gallery of images, managing them according to your preferences. You have the ability to upload, download, delete images, and edit them through cropping, resizing, rotating, enhancing or resetting image quality. Upon making edits, a new version of the image is saved alongside the original. Additionally, you can create and organize image categories such as sport, art, and nature.
The application also provides features for visualizing image characteristics, including dominant colors, color histograms, and moment colors. A dedicated space allows you to analyze image similarities; the selected image serves as a query, and the system identifies and presents similar images. Following this, you can vote on the relevance of these images, choosing from options like highly relevant, relevant, no opinion, not relevant, and highly not relevant. If, for instance, you vote a similar image as not relevant, the system will automatically provide a more suitable similar image that closely matches your query. This application offers a truly enjoyable user experience!
